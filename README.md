This is an implementation of Louvain Algorithm for Community Detection.


To run the project navigate to **_louv>src_**

```
cd src
```


```
python ./main.py
```


Initially the output is fed in the main.py file but ideally the output from louvain.py should be provided to main.py


This implementation for now uses a [karate_club_graph()](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.social.karate_club_graph.html) for its dataset
